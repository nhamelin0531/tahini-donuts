                <p>Tahini is a very versatile ingredient and condiment being used in salads, meats and many desserts as well, including the donut. But why put tahini in a donut?

                <h2>Section 2</h2>
                <p>Because tahini is mainly used in the filling or icing of a donut there is a lot you can do. Like regular donuts there are many types of donuts made using tahini. There are salted, maple glazed, chocolate and many other types. These donuts can also be healthier depending on the other ingredients used in the donut. This makes sure a donut made with tahini can both be made healthier and given a different taste than a regular donut.</p>
